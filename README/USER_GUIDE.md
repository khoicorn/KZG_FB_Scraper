### When No Results Are Found

Sometimes a domain might not have any results. Don't worry - the bot will let you know why!

**Example:**
```
You: search nonexistenttestdomain123.com

     You might want to check the Facebook Ads Library directly: [link provided]
```

The bot will provide a helpful link to Facebook Ads Library as an alternative resource.

## Tips for Best Results

### ‚úÖ Valid Domain Formats
**Good examples:**
- `chatbuypro.com`
- `thaidealzone.com` 

### ‚ùå Invalid Domain Formats to Avoid
**These won't work:**
- `invalid@domain.com` (contains @ symbol)
- `a.com` (too short)
- `no-dots` (missing domain extension)

### üîß Domain Format Tips
- Stick to basic domain format: `name.extension`
- Ensure the domain is truly valid

## Common Scenarios

### Multiple Users
If several people are using the bot at the same time, don't worry! The bot handles requests one at a time:

```
User 1: search amazon.com
User 2: search microsoft.com
Bot: You are #2 in queue. Please wait...
```

Everyone gets their turn, and the bot processes requests fairly in order.

### Error Messages
If something goes wrong, the bot will give you clear, helpful error messages:

**Common errors:**
- **Unrecognized command**: Suggests using `help` to see available commands
- **Missing domain**: Reminds you to include a domain name
